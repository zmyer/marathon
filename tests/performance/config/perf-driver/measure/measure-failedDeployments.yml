# Configuration Fragment : Measure Deployment Failures        #
# ----------------------------------------------------------- #
# This fragment installs a counter tracker that tracks the    #
# number of failed deployments.                               #
# ----------------------------------------------------------- #


# Global test configuration
# ===========================
config:

  # Define the metrics we are measuring
  metrics:
    - name: failedDeployments
      uuid: f1c4a1d569564600b7afe69e5f6a6548
      desc: How many deployment failures occurred
      summarize: [mean_err]
      units: deployments

  # Define the indicators that can summarise our values
  indicators:

    # Calculate `meanFailedDeployments` by calculating the normalizing average
    # of all the `failedDeployments` mean values, normalized against each test's
    # normalization expression
    - name: meanFailedDeployments
      class: indicator.NormalizedMeanMetricIndicator
      metric: failedDeployments.mean_err
      normalizeto: "{{normalize_to}}"

# Tracker configuration
# ===========================
trackers:

  # Track failedDeployments as the number of failed deployment events in the
  # tracking session
  - class: tracker.CountTracker
    metric: failedDeployments
    events: MarathonDeploymentFailedEvent

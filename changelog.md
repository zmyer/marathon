## Changes from 1.5.x to 1.6.0

### Breaking changes

#### SentryAppender

The Sentry Raven log appender has been updated to version 8.0.x. Users that have enabled the Sentry Raven appender will need to update their configuration according to the [sentry migration guide](https://docs.sentry.io/clients/java/migration/).

### 1.5.1 New Behavior
#### Migrating unreachableStrategy - running instances

If you already migrated your apps and pods to the new default behavior for `UnreachableStrategy`, you also should consider to migrate the running instances as well.

To change the `unreachableStrategy` of all running instances, set the environment variable `MIGRATION_1_4_6_UNREACHABLE_STRATEGY` to `true`, which leads to the following behavior during migration:

When opting in to the unreachable migration step
1) all instances that had a config of `UnreachableStrategy(300 seconds, 600 seconds)` (previous default) are migrated to have `UnreachableStrategy(0 seconds, 0 seconds)`
2) all instances that had a config of `UnreachableStrategy(1 second, x seconds)` are migrated to have `UnreachableStrategy(0 seconds, x seconds)`
3) all instances that had a config of `UnreachableStrategy(1 second, 2 seconds)` are migrated to have `UnreachableStrategy(0 seconds, 0 seconds)`

**Note**: If you set this variable after upgrading to 1.4.9, it will have no effect.

### 1.5.1 New Behavior

#### mesosphere.marathon.plugin.scheduler.SchedulerPlugin

This plugin allows to reject offers. Possible use-cases are:
  * Maintenance. Mark agent as going to maintenance and reject new offers from it.
  * Analytics. If task fails, for example, 5 times for 5 minutes, we can assume that it will fail again and reject new offers for it.
  * Binding to agents. For example, agents can be marked as included into primary or secondary group. Task can be marked with group name.  Plugin can schedule task deployment to primary agents. If all primary agents are busy, task can be scheduled to secondary agents


## Changes from 1.4.x to 1.5.0

### Recommended Mesos version is 1.3.0

### Breaking Changes

#### Packaging standardized

We now publish more normalized packages that attempt to follow Linux Standard Base Guidelines and use sbt-native-packager to achieve this.
As a result of this and the many historic ways of passing options into marathon, we will only read `/etc/default/marathon` when starting up.
This file, like `/etc/sysconfig/marathon`, has all marathon command line options as "MARATHON_XXX=YYY" which will translate to `--xx=yyy`.
We no longer support /etc/marathon/conf which was a set of files that would get translated into command line arguments. In addition,
we no longer assume that if there is no zk/master argument passed in, then both are running on localhost.

If support for any of the above is important to you, please file a JIRA and/or create a PR/Patch.


#### App JSON Fields Changed or Moved.

Marathon will continue to *accept* the app JSON as it did in 1.4;
however, applications that use deprecated fields will be normalized into a canonical representation.
The app JSON *generated* by the /v2 REST API has changed: only canonical fields are generated.
The [App RAML specification](docs/docs/rest-api/public/api/v2/types/app.raml) is the source of truth with respect to deprecated fields.
The following deprecated fields will no longer be generated for app JSON:

- `ipAddress`
- `container.docker.portMappings`
- `container.docker.network`
- `ports`
- `uris`

Marathon clients that consume these deprecated fields will require changes.
In addition, new networking API fields have been introduced:

- `networks`
- `container.portMappings`

The `networks` field replaces the `ipAddress.networkName` and `container.docker.network` fields, and supports joining an app to multiple `container` networks.
The legacy IP/CT API did not require a resolvable network name in order to use a `container` network;
it allowed both an app definition to leave `ipAddress.networkName` unspecified **and** the operator to leave `--default_network_name` unspecified.
Starting with Marathon v1.5 such apps will be rejected: apps may leave `networks[x].name` unspecified for `container` networks only if `--default_network_name` has been specified by the operator.
Marathon injects the value of `--default_network_name` into unnamed `container` networks upon app create/update.

Upgrading from Marathon 1.4.x to Marathon 1.5.x will automatically migrate existing applications to the new networking API.
Migration of legacy Mesos IP/CT apps **may fail** if those apps did not specify `ipAddress.networkName` and there is no default network name specified.
See the (networking documentation)[docs/docs/networking.md] for details concerning app migration and network API changes.

The [old app networking docs](docs/docs/ports.md) have been relocated.
See the [networking documentation](docs/docs/networking.md) for details concerning the new API.

#### Metric Names Changed or Moved.
We moved to a different Metrics library and the metrics are not _always_ compatible or the same as existing metrics;
however, the metrics are also now more accurate, use less memory, and are expected to get better throughout the release.
Where it was possible, we maintained the original metric names/groupings/etc, but some are in new locations or have
slightly different semantics. Any monitoring dashboards should be updated.

Before 1.5.0 releases, we will publish a migration guide for the new metric formats and where the replacement
metrics can be found and the formats they are now in.

#### Artifact store has been removed
The artifact store was deprecated with Marathon 1.4 and is removed in version.
The command line flag `--artifact_store` will throw an error if specified.
The REST API endpoint `/v2/artifacts` has been removed completely.

#### Logging endpoint
Marathon has the ability to view and change log level configuration during runtime via the `/logging` endpoint.
This version switches from a form based API to a JSON based API, while maintaining the functionality.
We also secured this endpoint, so you can restrict who is allowed to view or update this configuration.
Please find our [API documentation](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/api-console/index.html) for all details.

#### Event Subscribers has been removed.
The events subscribers endpoint (`/v2/eventSubscribers`) was deprecated in Marathon 1.4 and is removed in this version.
Please move to the `/v2/events` endpoint instead.

#### Removed command line parameters
- The command line flag `max_tasks_per_offer` has been deprecated since 1.4 and is removed now. Please use `max_instances_per_offer`.

#### Deprecated command line parameters
- The command line flag `save_tasks_to_launch_timeout` is deprecated and has no effect any longer.

### Overview

#### Networking Improvements Involving Multiple Container Networks

The field `networkNames` has been added to [app container's ContainerPortMapping](docs/docs/rest-api/public/api/v2/types/appContainer.raml) and [pod's Endpoint](docs/docs/rest-api/public/api/v2/types/network.raml). Using the field, an app or pod participating in multiple container networks can now forward ports by specifying a single item `networkNames`. For more information, see the [networking documentation](./docs/docs/networking.md).

Additionally container port discovery has been improved, with a pod or app being able specify with which container network(s) a port name/protocol/etc is associated. Discovery labels are now generated for container networks associated with ports.

#### Mesos Bridge Network Name Configurable

The CNI network used for Mesos containers when bridge networking is now configurable via the command-line argument `--mesos_bridge_name`. As with other command-line-args, this can also be specified via `MARATHON_MESOS_BRIDGE_NAME`, as well.

#### Backup and Restore Operations

You can now backup and restore Marathon's internal state via the [DELETE /v2/leader](./docs/docs/rest-api/public/api/v2/leader.raml) API endpoint.

See [MARATHON-7041](https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/MARATHON-7041)

#### TTY support

You can now specify that a TTY should be allocated for app or pod containers. See the [TTY definition](./docs/docs/rest-api/public/api/v2/types/containerCommons.raml). An example can be found in [v2/examples/app.json](./docs/docs/rest-api/public/api/v2/examples/app.json).

See [MARATHON-7062](https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/MARATHON-7062)

#### Improved Validation Error Messages

All validation specified in the RAML is now programatically enforced, leading to more consistent, descriptive, and legible error messages.

#### Security improvements

Marathon is in better compliance with various security best-practices. An example of this is that Marathon no longer responds to the directory listing request.

#### File-based secrets

Marathon has a pluggable interface for secret store providers.
Previous versions of Marathon allowed secrets to be passed as environment variables.
With this version it is also possible to provide secrets as volumes, mounted under a specified path.
See [file based secret documentation](http://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/secrets.html)

#### Changes around unreachableStrategy

Recent changes in Apache Mesos introduced the ability to handle intermittent connectivity to an agent which may be running a Marathon task. This change introduced the `TASK_UNREACHABLE`. This allows for the ability for a node to disconnect and reconnect to the cluster without having a task replaced. This resulted in (based on default configurations) of a delay of 75 seconds before Marathon would be notified by Mesos to replace the task. The previous behavior of Marathon was usually sub-second replacement of a lost task.

It is now possible to configure `unreachableStrategy` for apps and pods to instantly replace unreachable apps or pods. To enable this behavior, you need to configure your app or pod as shown below:

```
{
  ...
  "unreachableStrategy": {
    "inactiveAfterSeconds": 0,
    "expungeAfterSeconds": 0
  },
  ...
}
```

**Note**: Instantly means as soon as marathon becomes aware of the unreachable task. By default, Marathon is notified after 75 seconds by Mesos
  that an agent is disconnected. You can change this duration in Mesos by configuring `agent_ping_timeout` and `max_agent_ping_timeouts`.

#### Migrating unreachableStrategy

If you want all of your apps and pods to adopt a `UnreachableStrategy` that retains the previous behavior where instance were immediately replaced so that you does not have to update every single app definition.

To change the `unreachableStrategy` of all apps and pods, set the environment variable `MIGRATION_1_4_6_UNREACHABLE_STRATEGY` to `true`, which leads to the following behavior during migration:

When opting in to the unreachable migration step
1) all app and pod definitions that had a config of `UnreachableStrategy(300 seconds, 600 seconds)` (previous default) are migrated to have `UnreachableStrategy(0 seconds, 0 seconds)`
2) all app and pod definitions that had a config of `UnreachableStrategy(1 second, x seconds)` are migrated to have `UnreachableStrategy(0 seconds, x seconds)`
3) all app and pod definitions that had a config of `UnreachableStrategy(1 second, 2 seconds)` are migrated to have `UnreachableStrategy(0 seconds, 0 seconds)`

**Note**: If you set this variable after upgrading to 1.4.6, it will have no effect. Also, the `UnreachableStrategy` default has not been changed, so in order for apps and pods created in the future to have the replace-instantly behavior, `unreachableStrategy`'s `inactiveAfterSeconds` and `expungeAfterSeconds` must be set to 0 as seen in the JSON above.

### Known issues


## Changes from 1.4.0 to 1.4.1
Bugfix release

### Fixed issues
- Fixes #5211 - Re-enabling `PUT` on `/v2/apps`

### Known issues

- [Marathon does not re-use reserved resources for which a lost task is associated](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/issues/4137). In
  the event that a resident task becomes lost (due to a somewhat common event such as rebooting the host on which the
  mesos agent and task are running), then the resident task becomes `Unreachable`. Once it becomes this state, Marathon
  will consider the task gone and create additional reservations (it should probably wait until it becomes
  `UnreachableInactive` to do this). Even though the prior reservation is re-offered, Marathon will not use it.

- [Data migration for UnreachableDisabled](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/issues/5209)

## Changes from 1.3.10 to 1.4.0

### Recommended Mesos version is 1.1.0

### Breaking Changes

#### Plugin API has changed
In order to support the nature of pods, we had to change the plugin interfaces in a backward incompatible fashion.
Plugin writers need to update plugins, in order to use this version.

* There is a new `NetworkSpec` plugin interface that may be of interest for Mesos network module writers.
* Some existing plugin APIs were modified in support of the new pods primitive (see Overview/Pods).

#### Health reporting via the event stream
Adding support for pods in Marathon required the internal representation of tasks to be migrated to instances. An instance represents the executor on the Mesos side, and contains a list of tasks. This change is reflected in various parts of the API, which now accordingly reports health status etc for instances, not for tasks.
Until v1.3.x, Marathon published `health_status_changed_event`s via the event stream. With the introduction of instances that can contain multiple tasks, Marathon moved away from that event in favor of `instance_health_changed_event`s.
In case you were consuming that event you have to adjust your tooling to consume the introduced event instead, e.g.
```javascript
{
    "instanceId": "some_app.marathon-49d976d3-9c6f-11e6-93cb-0242216b9f0d",
    "runSpecId": "/some/app",
    "healthy": true,
    "runSpecVersion": "2016-10-18T10:42:47.499Z",
    "timestamp": "2016-10-27T18:00:50.401Z",
    "eventType": "instance_health_changed_event"
}
```

Accordingly, the `failed_health_check_event` now reports an instanceId instead of a taskId:
```javascript
{
    "instanceId": "some_app.marathon-49d976d3-9c6f-11e6-93cb-0242216b9f0d",
    ...
    "eventType": "failed_health_check_event"
}
```

This change affects the following API primitives in a similar way:
- `unhealthy_instance_kill_event` (in favor of the previous `unhealthy_task_kill_event`) provides both the instanceId of the instance that got killed, as well as the taskId designating the task that failed health checks.
- Health information as reported via the apps and tasks endpoint.

### Overview

#### Pods

A pod is a collection of co-located and co-scheduled containers in a shared context.
The containers of a pod share a network namespace and may share access to the same filesystem(s).
Each pod instance’s containers are individually resource-isolated.

[Mesos 1.1](http://mesos.apache.org/blog/mesos-1-1-0-released) adds support for launching a group of tasks (LAUNCH_GROUP).
A pod instance’s containers are launched via this Mesos primitive.
Mesos provides the executor implementation that Marathon will use to run pod instances.

We created a new primitive, PodDefinition, as well as new API endpoints.
Read more about to use pods in our [Pods Documentation](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/pods.html),
and the `/v2/pods` section of the [REST API Reference](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/generated/api.html)

Pods are implemented as a new primitive in Marathon.
The general functionality of apps plus the related endpoints are still available.

#### Mesos-based health checks for HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP

Health checks are an integral part of application monitoring and have been available in Marathon since version 0.7.
At the time that health checks were first added to Marathon, there was no support for health checks in Mesos.
Prior to the availability of Mesos-based health checks, health checks were only performed directly in Marathon. This has the following consequences:
- Marathon has to share the same network as the tasks to monitor, so it can reach all launched tasks
- Network partitions could lead to wrong scheduling decisions
- The health state is not available via the Mesos state
- Marathon health checks do not scale to large numbers of tasks.

Starting with Mesos 1.1, it is now possible to perform network based health checks directly on the Mesos executor level.
Marathon makes all the Mesos-based health checks available.
See the updated [Health Check Documentation](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/health-checks.html),
especially the new protocols: `MESOS_HTTP`, `MESOS_HTTPS`, `MESOS_TCP`.

We strongly recommend Mesos-based health checks over Marathon-based health checks.
Marathon-based health checks are deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

#### New ZK persistent storage layout

ZooKeeper has a limitation on the number of nodes it can store in a directory node.
Until version 1.3, Marathon used a flat storage layout in ZooKeeper and encountered this limitation with large installations.
The latest version of Marathon uses a nested storage layout, which significantly increases the number of nodes that can be stored.

ZooKeeper has a limitation on the size of one node (typically 1MB).
In prior versions, a group was stored with all subgroups and applications.
This could lead to a node size larger than 1 MB, which could not be stored.
The latest version of Marathon stores a group only with references in order to keep node size under 1 MB.

A migration inside Marathon automatically migrates the prior layout to the new one.

#### Improve Task Lost behaviour

The connection between the Mesos master and an agent can be broken for several reasons (network partition, agent update, etc).
When this happens, there is limited knowledge of the status of the agent's tasks.
Prior versions of Mesos declared such tasks as lost after a timeout and killed the tasks if the agent rejoins the cluster.

Starting with Mesos 1.1, those task are declared unreachable, not lost.
The scheduler that launched the tasks decides how to handle unreachable tasks.

Marathon uses this feature and adds an `unreachableStrategy` to the AppDefinition and PodDefinition, which allows you to define:
- `inactiveAfterSeconds`: how long Marathon should wait to start a replacement task.
- `expungeAfterSeconds`: how long Marathon should wait for a task to come back.

If a task comes back and the replacement task is already started, Marathon needs to decide which task to kill.
In order to let the user define which task should be taken, a kill selection can be defined.

#### Insights into the Launch Process - AKA: Why isn't my app starting?

Marathon tries to schedule tasks based on app or pod definition, which incorporates resource matching, role matching, constraint matching etc.
There are situations when Marathon cannot fulfill a launch request, since there is no matching offer from Mesos.
It was very hard for users to understand why Marathon could not fulfill launch requests.
For users that run into such situations, it was very hard to understand the reasons for this.
This version of Marathon gives insight into the launch process, analyzes all incoming offers and gives the user
statistics so it easy to see, why offers were rejected.

The statics can be fetched via the `/v2/queue` endpoint. See the [REST API Reference](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/generated/api.html).
Marathon shows the offer matching process as a funnel, so it easy to see how many offers were rejected in which step.
It gives this information for the whole launch attempt as well as the last offer cycle.


#### Improve Deployment logic

During Marathon master failover all deployments are started from the beginning.
This can be cumbersome if you have long-running updates and a Marathon failover.
This version of Marathon reconciles the state of a deployment after a failover.
A running deployment will be continued on the new elected leader without restarting the deployment.

Every state change operation via the REST API will now return the deployment identifier as an HTTP response header.


#### Added support for PATCH on `/v2/apps`
To handle partial updates with the semantical correct HTTP verb, a support for `PATCH` on `/v2/apps` was introduced. Support for partial updates through `PUT` was deprecated, see below.


### Deprecations

#### Deprecate Marathon-based Health Checks

Mesos now supports command-based as well as network-based health checks.
Since those health check types are now also available in Marathon, the Marathon-based health checks are now deprecated.
Do not use health checks with the following protocols: `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, and `TCP`. Instead, use the Mesos equivalents: `MESOS_HTTP`, `MESOS_HTTPS` and `MESOS_TCP`.


#### Deprecate Event Callback Subscriptions

Marathon has two ways to subscribe to the internal event bus:
- HTTP callback events managed via `/v2/eventSubscriptions`
- Server Send Events via `/v2/events` (since Marathon 0.9)

We encourage everyone to use the `/v2/events` SSE stream instead of HTTP Callback listeners.
The event callback subscriptions will be removed in a future version.

#### Deprecate Artifact Store

The artifact store was introduced as an easy solution to store and retrieve artifacts and make them available in the cluster.
There is a variety of tools that can handle this functionality better then Marathon.
We will remove this functionality from Marathon without replacement.

#### Deprecate PATCH semantic for PUT on /v2/apps

A PUT on /v2/apps has a PATCH like semantic:
All values that are not defined in the json, will not update existing values.
This was always the default behaviour in Marathon versions.
For backward compatibility, we will not change this behaviour, but let users opt in for a proper PUT.
The next version of Marathon will use PATCH and PUT as two separate actions.

#### Forcefully stop a deployment

Deployments in Marathon can be stopped with force.
All actions currently being performed in Marathon will be stopped; the state will not change.
This can lead to an inconsistent state and is dangerous.
We will remove this functionality without replacement.

#### Deprecated command line parameters
- Removed the deprecated `marathon_store_timeout` command line parameter. It was deprecated since v0.12 and unused.
- Mark `task_lost_expunge_gc` as deprecated, since it is not used any longer
- The command line flag `max_tasks_per_offer` is deprecated. Please use `max_instances_per_offer`.
- The deprecated command line flag `enable_metrics` is removed. Please use the toggle `metrics` and `disable_metrics`
- The deprecated command line flag `enable_tracing` is removed. Please use the toggle `tracing` and `disable_tracing`

### Known issues

- [Marathon does not re-use reserved resources for which a lost task is associated](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/issues/4137). In
  the event that a resident task becomes lost (due to a somewhat common event such as rebooting the host on which the
  mesos agent and task are running), then the resident task becomes `Unreachable`. Once it becomes this state, Marathon
  will consider the task gone and create additional reservations (it should probably wait until it becomes
  `UnreachableInactive` to do this). Even though the prior reservation is re-offered, Marathon will not use it.
- [Marathon can confuse port-mapping in resident tasks](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/issues/4819)
- [Marathon does not read resident task information properly from the persistence layer](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/issues/5165)

## Changes from 1.3.5 to 1.3.6

### Fixed issues:

- When a runtime exit is requested, if the exit does not complete in less than the requested amount of time (10 seconds by default),
   now will actually kill the JVM. Previously, the timeout code did not actually work at all.
- Marathon will now terminate upon loss of leadership instead of becoming a non-master. This prevents a lot of potentially unsafe
   behavior and a watchdog will instead bring marathon back up in a clean state.

## Changes from 1.3.4 to 1.3.5

### Fixed Issues

*Warning* - while very rare, this can change the behavior of existing applications:

- Constraint Validation was significantly improved in marathon 1.3.x and previous values for regular expressions
for LIKE and UNLIKE may no longer pass validation as they are not valid regular expressions. Where possible,
we will correct the regular expression (specifically '*' to '.*'); however, when this is not possible,
_the constraint will be removed_ and a warning will be logged for the app Ids that were affected.

## Changes from 1.3.3 to 1.3.4

### Fixed issues:

- Fix an issue where constraint validation was improved and existing apps
  were not migrated to fix the constraints in the common error cases, e.g. `*` to `.*`
- Fix #4470 - Log an error if we can't deserialize a task when migrating
   instead of failing completely.
- Fix migration issues related to task status/condition.
- Fix misleading healthbeat logs, only log when there is a potential problem.
- Don't wait for kills to finish, related to #4191

- Fixes #4185 - Add documenting/protecting tests as well as a protecting test for .container

## Changes from 1.1.0 to 1.3.0

### Recommended Mesos version is 1.0.0

### Breaking Changes

#### You need Mesos 1.0.0 or higher
Starting with Marathon 1.2.0, Mesos 1.0.0 or later is required.

#### New leader election library
The leader election code has been greatly improved and is based on [Curator](http://curator.apache.org),a well-known, well-tested library. The new leader election functionality is now more robust.

__Caution: the new leader election library is not compatible with Marathon versions prior to 1.2.0__
To upgrade to this version, stop all older Marathon instances before the new version starts.
Otherwise, there is a risk of more than one leading master.


#### Framework authentication command line flags
Prior versions of Marathon have tried to authenticate whenever a principal has been provided via the command line.
Framework authentication is now explicit. There is a command line toggle option for authentication: `--mesos_authentication`.
This toggle is disabled by default. You must now supply this flag to use framework authentication.

#### Changed default values for TASK_LOST GC timeout
If a task is declared lost in Mesos, but the reason indicates it might come back, Marathon waits for the task to come back for a certain amount of time.
To configure the behavior you can use `--task_lost_expunge_gc`, `--task_lost_expunge_initial_delay`, `--task_lost_expunge_interval`.
Until version 1.3 Marathon has handled TASK_LOST very conservatively: it waits for 24 hours for every task to come back.
This version reduces the timeout to 75 seconds (task_lost_expunge_gc), while checking every 30 seconds (task_lost_expunge_interval).




### Overview
#### Universal Containerizer
Starting with version 1.3.0, Marathon supports docker container images without having the Docker Containerizer depend on a Docker Engine. Instead the Mesos containerizer with native AppC support added in Apache Mesos version 1.0 (released July 2016) directly uses native OS features to configure and start Docker containers and to provide isolation.

#### TASK_LOST behavior
If Mesos agents get detached from the Mesos master, all tasks are assumed LOST.
The reaction of Marathon in the past was to kill LOST tasks. Under certain configurations, however, those agents were able to rejoin the cluster, so LOST was not a terminal state.

In this version, Marathon will wait until a LOST task is assumed dead. This amount of time is configurable. The default timeout is 75 seconds. LOST tasks after that timeout get killed by Marathon.

This change was so important that we back ported this functionality to prior versions of Marathon.

#### Task Kill Grace Period
Every application can now define a kill grace period.
When killing a task, the agent will wait in a best-effort manner for the grace period specified before forcibly destroying the task.
The task must not assume that it will always be allotted the full grace period, as the agent may decide to allot a shorter period and failures/forcible terminations may occur.

#### MAX_PER constraint
Applications in Marathon can now be constrained by MAX_PER operators.
It can be used, for example, to limit tasks across racks or data centers.

#### Virtual heartbeat monitor
Previous versions of Marathon did not recognize when it had been detached from Mesos master during network partitions.
The virtual heart beat will make sure that Marathon recognizes this situation and abdicates.

#### Authorization to system endpoints
Marathon already has authorization hooks for AppDefinition and Group changes.
We added authorization hooks for system endpoints: `/v2/leader`, `/v2/info`, `/v2/events` , `/v2/eventSubscriptions`.

#### Support for secrets API
It is now possible to use secrets in your AppDefinition.
Secrets are defined as a first-class entity and are used inside environment variables.
Please note: there is no native Mesos support for secrets at the moment.
We have defined a plugin interface to handle secrets.
You need a plugin in order to use this feature effectively.

#### Support for Nvidia GPU
It is now possible to use `gpus` as Nvidia GPU resource required in your AppDefinition.
`gpus` is defined as a first-class entity and can be supported by Mesos containerizer when
`--enable_features gpu_resources` flag is set in Marathon.
Please note: this feature is valid only when Mesos is compiled with Nvidia GPU support.

#### Support all attribute types with constraints
Non-text type attributes (such as scalar or range) are now supported.

#### ZooKeeper digest authentication support
The ZK client now supports ZK authentication and ACLs.

#### Support for virtual networking for docker containers.
Added support for Docker `USER` networking.

#### CNI networking support
Added the optional field `ipAddress.Name`, which can be used to start a task using CNI networking.

#### Enforce the uniqueness of service ports
Marathon will now ensure for newly created or updated applications, that the services ports are not used by another application.

__Caution: this change might lead to Marathon rejecting app definitions that used to be accepted by previous versions.__

We have been focusing our efforts on two big new features for the upcoming DC/OS v1.8 release and had to work around the feature freeze in the Marathon v1.2 release candidates. Therefore, we discontinued work on the v1.2 release in favor of a new Marathon v1.3 release candidate.
See: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/marathon-framework/j6fNc4xk5tQ


## Changes from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

### Recommended Mesos version is 0.28.0

### Overview

#### Readiness Checks for applications

Marathon already has the concept of health checks, which periodically monitor the health of an application.
During deployments and runtime configuration updates, however, you might want a temporary monitor that waits for your application to be _ready_.
A temporary monitor can be useful for cache-warming, JIT warming, or a migration. Marathon offers a readiness check for these situations.

Readiness checks are performed only during deployment time after a task has been launched.
The deployment will wait for the readiness check to succeed, before the deployment continues.
For easy integration with other tools, the result of the readiness checks is available via the deployments endpoint or the app/group listing.
We are keen to know what you think about this feature.

#### Support for external volumes (experimental)

Marathon applications normally lose their state when they terminate and are relaunched.
In some contexts, for instance, if your application uses MySQL, you’ll want your application to preserve its state.
You can use an external storage service, such as Amazon's Elastic Block Store (EBS), to create a persistent volume that follows your application instance.
Using an external storage service allows your apps to be more fault-tolerant.
If a host fails, Marathon reschedules your app on another host, along with its associated data, without user intervention.

Please Note that you have to setup your Mesos cluster correctly in order to use this feature.

#### Local Volumes

In prior versions Marathon had to authenticate with Mesos in order to use local volumes.
While this is still possible, we removed this prerequisite.
Using this version it is enough to set a framework principal without providing credentials.

### Fixed issues

## Changes from 0.15.3 to 1.0.0

### Recommended Mesos version is 0.28.0

### Breaking Changes

#### New default settings for Task Launches

Marathon has a lot of settings to adjust. Our goal is, to have sensible defaults for small and medium size clusters.
We realized, that some default values are not sufficient in the field and changed them:

- `--launch_tokens` has changed to 100 (was 1000)
- `--max_tasks_per_offer` has changed to 5 (was 100)
- `--reconciliation_interval` has changed to 600000 (=10 minutes) (was 300000 (=5 minutes))

#### Updated Auth plugin interface

The Authentication and Authorization plugin interface was redesigned in order to support more sophisticated plugins.

### Overview

#### Support for Persistent Storage

You can now launch tasks that use persistent volumes by specifying volumes either via the UI or the REST API.
Marathon will reserve all required resources on a matching agent, and subsequently launch a task on that same agent if
needed. Data within the volume will be retained even after relaunching the associated task. This release provides basic
functionality which we plan to extend in the future, so use it at your own risk.

Check it out and give us feedback!

See the [feature documentation](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/persistent-volumes.html) for details and
configuration examples.

#### Support for ports metadata

The v2 REST API was extended to support additional ports metadata (protocol, name, and labels) through the
`portDefinition` application field.  Marathon will pass this new information to Mesos, who will in turn make it
available for service discovery purposes.

Note: the `portDefinitions` array deprecates the `ports` array.

#### Support for HTTP based plugin extensions

Plugins can now implement HTTP endpoints.

#### Added a leaderDuration metric

The metrics include now a gauge that measures the time elapsed since the last leader election happened. This is helpful
to diagnose stability problems and how often leader election happens.

#### Better error messages
API error messages are now more consistent and easier to understand for both humans and computers.

#### Lots of documentation updates

#### Improved Task Kill behavior in deployments by performing kills in batches
When stopping/restarting an application, Marathon will now perform the kills in batches, in order to avoid overwhelming
Mesos. The batch size and frequency can be controlled via internal configuration parameters.

#### Support the `TASK_KILLING` state available in Mesos 0.28
It is possible to make Marathon let Mesos use the `TASK_KILLING` state introduced in Mesos 0.28 using the
`--enable_features task_killing` flag. Marathon doesn't use this task state yet.

## Fixed issues

This is a bug fix release.

## Fixed issues

- #3192 - Adapt default Mem/CPU settings
- #3251 - Tried to kill an existing app, said it doesn't exist even though it does


## Changes from 0.15.1 to 0.15.2

This release includes fixes for two bugs introduced in 0.15.0.

## Fixed issues

- #3172 - "Apply" button is broken (sending both uris and fetch)
- #3242 - Treat "value" attribute in server-side validation errors as general error

## Changes from 0.15.0 to 0.15.1

This release includes fixes for several bugs introduced in 0.15.0.

## Fixed issues

- #3139 - Marathon 0.15.0 forces redeploy of app all the time
- #3054 - Empty application attributes are accidentally submited by the UI
- #3141 - Jetty throws exception during load
- #3164 - Marathon 0.15 error on bad application id is really bad
- #3160 - Show 400 error for Constraints field
- #3140 - breaking API change on portIndex

## Changes from 0.14.0 to 0.15.0

### Recommended Mesos version is 0.26.0

We tested this release against Mesos version 0.26.0. Thus, this is the recommended Mesos version for this
release.

### Overview

#### Integration of Mesos Fetcher Cache

The v2 REST API was extended to support the Mesos fetcher cache. This allows users to configure a list of resource URIs
that will be copied into the task sandbox prior to running the task, from either a local or external location. For
details on the fetcher cache's capabilities, please see the fetcher cache [documentation](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/fetcher/).

#### Migration from Marathon version 0.7 or lower removed

It is no longer possible to migrate from Marathon versions prior to version 0.8. If you want to upgrade old
versions we recommend to do a step by step migration using the latest stable version following your installed version
and so on.

#### haproxy-marathon-bridge is deprecated and removed from the bin directory

In recent versions we published a simple shell script to update haproxy configuration.
marathon-lb is the successor of this script and can be found here: https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon-lb
The script can still be found in the examples directory.

### Under the Hood

There have been a lot of interesting changes which we only summarize for now. In the next days, we will
follow up with extend documentation about them.

#### New metrics

We will provide some cursory introduction into important metrics soon.

#### Limit concurrent status update processing

We now limit the maximum number of concurrently processed task status updates. If the limit is reached,
further status updates are queued. The queue is limited, too, so that at some point new status updates
are rejected and not acknowledged. Eventually, Mesos will resend the status updates that we didn't process.

#### Task state tracking redesign

We have rewritten the component that holds the task states: the `TaskTracker`. We removed the old implementation
that used concurrent data structures, and now use an actor based implementation. The new implementation is easier to
reason about and allows explicit concurrency management as described in the last section.

#### Explicit queuing of application configuration updates

Marathon has been serializing updates to the app configuration for a while. We made queuing outstanding
configuration requests explicit and also limited the maximum size of the queue.

#### Optimized /v2/tasks (TXT)

Since some service discovery solutions poll this end-point, performance is important. We improved
request rates by about 30%.

#### Changes to the threading model

Prior to this release, Marathon would create new threads when needed. Now we switched to a model where we
have some fixed size thread pools and thread pools that will only grow if too many threads have become blocked.
This should reduce the number of threads under load.

#### Model validation

Marathon is now utilizing [Accord](http://wix.github.io/accord/), a modern approach to model validation which will
hopefully leads to better error messages in the future.

### Marathon UI

A number of very convenient features and improvements made it into this release.

#### Perform actions directly from the Applications list
A new contextual dropdown menu in the Applications list gives access to the most useful actions (scale, destroy,
suspend, etc.) without having to enter an application's detail view. Additionally, it is now possible to perform scale
and delete operations on entire Groups.

#### Better feedback
The feedback dialogs have been completely redesigned to be clearer and more useful, adding three possible color-coded
severity levels: `info`, `warning` and `error`. In addition, the action button labels have been rephrased for improved
usability. Buttons that may lead to dangerous actions (such as "force scale") are also not preselected by default anymore.

#### Application Health
The health status breakdown is now also shown in the application details page.

#### ...and much more
For the complete set of changes, please refer to the [Marathon UI CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon-ui/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

### Fixed issues
- #2918 - Incorrect Step-wise timers in TaskStatusUpdateProcessorImpl
- #2919 - StateMetrics.timed(Read/Write) incorrectly used for methods returning Futures
- #2951 - Incorrect Constraint lead to an application exception, but should give an error response
- #2957 - Unbounded ThreadPool is used for too many operations
- #2982 - Double offerLeadership invocation after driver failure
- #2989 - Report task count metrics
- #2868 - Marathon sometimes tries (and fails) to assign duplicated service ports
- #2938 - Don't log giant port lists
- #2855 - Create app failed when there're multiple same word in the app id
- #3051 - Can't add dynamic ports using PUT
- #2892 - Version in task detail component shouldn't be localised
- #2893 - App page component should display the right number of tasks
- #2949 - AjaxWrapper does't handle TypeError correctly
- #3605 - Prevent ctrl-c keyboard shortcut from showing the Create modal dialog
- #3054 - Empty - non set- application attributes are accidentaly submited by the UI
- #3064 - Labels dropdown menu not showing up
- #3063 - After scaling a healthy app to 0, it appears to be Infinity% overcapacity

## Changes from 0.13.0 to 0.14.0

### Recommended Mesos version is 0.26.0

We tested this release against Mesos version 0.26.0. Thus, this is the recommended Mesos version for this
release.

### Breaking Changes
Marathon will not start up if there's an error registering with the current framework id. The previous behaviour was to
register as a new framework. We changed this in order to avoid orphaning the running tasks in case of transient errors.

### Overview

#### Expose additional app definition variables
The following environment variables are now available to the tasks:

- `MARATHON_APP_RESOURCE_CPUS` contains the value of the app definition `cpus` value.
- `MARATHON_APP_RESOURCE_MEM` contains the value of the app definition `mem` value, expressed in megabytes.
- `MARATHON_APP_RESOURCE_DISK`  value of the app definition `disk` value, expressed in megabytes.
- `MARATHON_APP_LABELS` contains list of labels of the corresponding app definition. For example: `label1 label2 label3`
- `MARATHON_APP_LABEL_NAME` contains value of label "NAME" of the corresponding app definition.

#### Health Checks: allow port instead of portIndex
Previously, the port to be used for health checks could only be specified by supplying a port index.  Now it
can also be specified directly using the new `port` field.

#### Improved search in the UI
Previously, the user could search through applications using a field which filtered all applications.
In 0.14.0 we replace the filter with a search which leads to a detailed search result view. There are
various improvements in the search interaction, including the user being returned to their former group
context after the search term has been cleared.

#### Better health status feedback
The health bars in the application list view are now provided in the application detail view. The tooltips
in the overview have been consolidated to make them easier to understand. The styles of the deployment table
have been updated inline with the applications list view. Additionally, it's possible to filter apps by their
health status in the UI.

#### IP-per-task UI
Some changes have been made in order to support IP-per-task in the API. The relevant part of the app
definition is exposed in the configuration page, and the `ipAddresses` field is integrated in the task
detail view.

#### Direct task log downloads for in the UI
The `stderr` and `stdout` logs can now be downloaded directly from the task view in the UI. The contents of
each task's sandbox is displayed and files are offered for direct download.

#### Health Checks: allow port instead of portIndex
Previously, the port to be used for health checks could only be specified by supplying a port index.  Now it
can also be specified directly using the new `port` field.

#### EXPERIMENTAL: IP-per-task support

This can drastically simplify service discovery, since you can use
[mesos-dns](https://github.com/mesosphere/mesos-dns) to rely on DNS for service discovery. This enables your
applications to use address-only (A) DNS records in combination with known ports to connect to other
services -- as you would do it in a traditional static cluster environment.

You can request an IP-per-task with default settings like this:

```javascript
{
  "id": "/i-have-my-own-ip",
  // ... more settings ...
  "ipAddress": {}
}
```

Marathon passes down the request for the IP to Mesos. You have to make sure that you installed & configured
the appropriate
[Network Isolation Modules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17mXtAmdAXcNBwp_JfrxmZcQrs7EO6ancSbejrqjLQ0g) &
IP Access Manager (IPAM) modules in Mesos. The Marathon support for this feature requires Mesos v0.26.

If an application requires IP-per-task, then it can not request ports to be allocated in the slave.

Currently, this feature does not work in combination with Docker containers. We might still change some
aspects of the API and we appreciate your feedback.

#### Improved migrations from v0.11
It is now possible to resume interrupted ZooKeeper state migrations. That means that Marathon can now recover from
transient errors during the migration process.

#### EXPERIMENTAL: Network security groups

If your IP Access Manager (IPAM) supports it, you can refine your IP configuration using network security
groups and labels:

```javascript
{
  "id": "/i-have-my-own-ip",
  // ... more settings ...
  "ipAddress": {
    "groups": ["production"],
    "labels": {
      "some-meaningful-config": "potentially interpreted by the IPAM"
    }
  }
}
```

Network security groups only allow network traffic between tasks that have at least one of their configured
groups in common. This makes it easy to disallow your staging environment to interfere with production
traffic.

#### EXPERIMENTAL: Service Discovery

If an application requires IP-per-task, then it can not request ports to be allocated in the slave. It is
however still possible to describe the ports that the Application's tasks expose:

```javascript
{
  "id": "/i-have-my-own-ip",
  // ... more settings ...
  "ipAddress": {
    "discovery": {
      "ports": [
        { "number": 80, "name": "http", "protocol": "tcp" }
      ]
    }
      // ... more settings ...
  }
}
```

Marathon will pass down this information to Mesos (inside the DiscoveryInfo message) when starting new tasks,
[mesos-dns](https://github.com/mesosphere/mesos-dns) will then expose this information through IN SRV records.

In the future Marathon will also fill in the DiscoveryInfo message for applications that don't require
IP-per-task.

## Changes from 0.11.1 to 0.13.0

### Breaking Changes

#### Tasks keys and storage format in ZooKeeper
Marathon tasks are now stored in ZooKeeper using a generic implementation that has been around for
a while. In order to accomplish this, the keys under which tasks are stored had to be migrated and
do no longer contain redundant information about the app id. Additionally, the task storage format
in Zookeeper changed as well. Previous versions of Marathon will **not** be able to read the tasks'
status once these are migrated. Please backup your ZooKeeper state before migrating to this version.

#### Zookeeper Compression
ZK nodes larger than a certain threshold will now be compressed. This allows Marathon to handle
more apps and groups, but breaks backwards compatibility, because older versions of Marathon are
not able to parse compressed nodes. You can define the threshold with `--zk_compression_threshold`
which defaults to 64KB.
To disable this feature, start Marathon with the `--disable_zk_compression` flag.

#### Use logback as logging backend
We moved from log4j to [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch) backend.
If you are using custom log4j properties, you will have to migrate them to a logback configuration.
The log4j.properties to logback.xml [Translator](http://logback.qos.ch/translator/) can help you with that.


### Overview

#### Major changes to the UI layout
This version introduces major changes to the layout. In particular, the application list has been redesigned.
- A filter sidebar is introduced with the ability to combine filters or clear them.
  - Filter by application status
  - Filter by labels
- The application list now handles groups
- Groups are shown at the top of the application list
- A group route is introduced to display the contents of a group in the application list
- Breadcrumbs show the groups structure
- Breadcrumbs will be folded to "..." when there isn't room to render them in full
- App names are now shown in the app page and app list instead of app IDs
- The complete app ID is available in the configuration tab
- Application labels are shown by the application name in the application list
- Endpoints are shown in the tasks detail page
- The memory column shows the total amount of memory used by an application with a human readable unit
- The application status is displayed with a colored icon
- The instances and health columns have been combined into one called "Running Instances"
- The control buttons on the application page are shown on the left and are redesigned

#### Enable extensions to Marathon via Plugins
This version of Marathon ships with the ability to load and use external plugins.
With this functionality in place, you can extend and adapt functionality in Marathon to your specific needs.
We start this adventure with pluggable authentication and authorization hooks, but want to extend this
to various functionality inside of Marathon.

To start with this feature, please read [Plugin Documentation](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/plugin.html)
or see our [Example Plugins](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon-example-plugins).

Please check it out and give us feedback!
We are also interested in any recommendations for upcoming plugin hooks.

#### Pluggable Authentication and Authorization hooks
The probably most wanted feature in Marathon is the ability to have Authentication and Authorization.
Since this topic has so distinct requirements for different organizations, it is a perfect match for our new plugin mechanism.
This version now implements all the necessary hooks needed to secure most external interfaces to your specific needs.
If you are interested in a very simple implementation, you can look into the [Example Auth Plugin](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon-example-plugins/tree/master/auth)

#### Persistent Store Cache
All entities in the persistent store (ZK) are loaded into a cache during leader election.
Subsequent reads are delivered from that cache. Updates to entities also update the cache.
This cache should improve read access time significantly.
You can disable the cache with `--disable_store_cache`.

#### Greatly improved API Reference
With this release we integrated [RAML](http://raml.org) based API documentation.
The `/help` endpoint uses the [RAML Console](https://github.com/mulesoft/api-console) to show the API Reference.
The Github pages documentation now also uses that specification.
We had a lot of feedback for documentation improvements - so please give us your thoughts on that.

#### Graphite and DataDog reporter
We collect a lot of metrics in Marathon.
You can collect those metrics via the `/metrics` endpoint.
With those reporters you can transfer the data into either Graphite or DataDog and see the values over time.

#### Force action
Previous versions of the UI did not support sending the `?force=true` query parameter when the
user submitted a scale action or when changing an app's configuration. These actions would be
rejected if the app was locked by one or more deployments.
In this version, the user is presented with a modal confirmation dialog when a force action is
required to proceed.

#### Authentication errors
Authentication errors (401, 403) are now notified to the user by means of modal dialogs.

#### Improved application modal
The application create/edit modal has undergone significant architectural and UX improvements.
It is now possible to specify application labels, accepted resource roles, the user field and
health checks. Additionally, a more fine-grained input validation and error handling has been
implemented.

#### Bookmarkable search results
The text entered in the filter bar is immediately stored in the browser's URL bar, which makes
search results bookmarkable for quicker access.

#### Application detail view: configuration panel
The Configuration panel in the application's detail view sees a number of improvements and bug
fixes. The application labels and dependencies are now also shown, and the lifetime durations
are shown as "humanized".

#### Define the number of maximum apps
A new flag (`--max_apps`) has been introduced, which allows Marathon to limit the maximum number
of applications that may be created. This limit is disabled by default.


### Under the Hood

#### Introduce a plugin-interface module
We now publish a separate marathon-plugin-interface.jar with every Marathon release on our maven repository.
This artifact holds all the inerfaces needed to develop your own Marathon plugin.

#### Consolidate logging to use slf4j
We moved completely to slf4j as Logging API.

#### Several performance improvements
* A separate thread pool is used for health check operations
* Group and app creation is more efficient.

#### Introduce configurable zk node compression
We introduced zk compression which improves performance significantly. Compression can be turned on/off via cmd line flags and is enabled by default.

#### Tasks are now stored via the standard EntityRepository
The storage of tasks was handled separately in previous versions of Marathon.
With this change in place we handle all entities via the same interface.
This allows for globally available extensions (e.g. the store cache).

## Changes from 0.11.0 to 0.11.1

### Overview

This release includes fixes for critical bugs introduced in v0.11.0 and several performance
improvements that allow Marathon to handle a larger number of groups and applications.

#### Performance Improvements
This release introduces the following improvements which allow Marathon to handle a larger number of
applications. Because this is a bugfix release and they are not backwards compatible, they are are
available, but disabled by default:

* ZK nodes larger than a certain threshold can now be compressed. This allows Marathon to handle
  more apps and groups, but breaks backwards compatibility, because older versions of Marathon are
  not able to parse compressed nodes.

  To enable this feature, start Marathon with the `--zk_compression` flag.
* A new flag (`--max_apps`) has been introduced, which allows Marathon to limit the maximum number
  of applications that may be created. This limit is disabled by default, but we performed scale
  tests on this release and recommend setting the limit to 500.

#### Fixed issues
- #2353 - Never recover from race condition when scaling up
- #2369 - Large file URIs cause "Failed to fetch all URIs for container" error when pulling from HDFS
- #2360 - PUT /v2/groups triggers restart while PUT /v2/apps does not
- #2381 - Marathon stops apps instead of restart
- #2402 - Runtime privilege checkbox does not work
- #2398 - Blank docker image is created in app modal
- #2338 - Parameters in the Docker container settings are not taken into account

## Changes from 0.10.0 to 0.11.0

Attention! There have been some severe issues reported for 0.11. We will release fixes for them in [0.11.1](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/milestones/0.11.1).

### Breaking Changes

* Java 8 or higher is needed to run Marathon, since Java 6 and 7 support has reached end of life.
* `--revive_offers_for_new_apps` is now the default. If you want to avoid resetting filters
  if new tasks need to be started, you can disable this by `--disable_revive_offers_for_new_apps`.

### Overview

#### Marathon uses Java 8

Java 8 has been out for more than a year now. The support for older versions of Java has reached end of life.
We switched completely to the latest stable JVM release.
We compile, test and run Marathon against Java 8.
Note for the Marathon Docker image: the base image of Marathon is now the standard java:8-jdk docker image.

#### Faster reconciliation and links to task Mesos sandboxes

Marathon now saves the slaveID of newly launched tasks.
That leads to faster reconciliation for lost tasks and allows the UI to link to the mesos UI.

If the auto-discovered mesos UI is not reachable from wherever you access the Marathon UI from, you can
use the `--mesos_leader_ui_url` configuration to change the base URL of these links.

#### New versioning information in API and UI

We now have `"versionInfo"` with `"lastConfigChangeAt"` and `"lastScalingAt"` in the apps JSON of our API.
`"lastConfigChangeAt"` is the timestamp of the last change to the application that was not just a restart or
a scaling operation. `"lastScalingAt"` is the time stamp of the last scaling or restart operation.

##### Additional task statistics in the `/v2/apps` and `/v2/apps/{app id}` endpoints (Optional)

If you pass `embed=apps.taskStats`/`embed=app.taskStats` as a query parameter, you get additional taskStats
embedded in you app JSON.

Task statistics are provided for the following groups of tasks. If no tasks for the group exist, no statistics are
offered:

* `"withLatestConfig"` contains statistics about all tasks that run with the same config as the latest app version.
* `"startedAfterLastScaling"` contains statistics about all tasks that were started after the last scaling or
  restart operation.
* `"withOutdatedConfig"` contains statistics about all tasks that were started before the last config change which
  was not simply a restart or scaling operation.
* `"totalSummary"` contains statistics about all tasks.

Example JSON:

```javascript
{
  // ...
  "taskStats": {
    {
      "startedAfterLastScaling" : {
        "stats" : {
          "counts" : { // equivalent to tasksStaged, tasksRunning, tasksHealthy, tasksUnhealthy
            "staged" : 1,
            "running" : 100,
            "healthy" : 90,
            "unhealthy" : 4
          },
          // "lifeTime" is only included if there are running tasks.
          "lifeTime" : {
            // Measured from `"startedAt"` (timestamp of the Mesos TASK_RUNNING status update) of each running task
            // until now.
            "averageSeconds" : 20.0,
            "medianSeconds" : 10.0
          }
        }
      },
      "withLatestConfig" : {
        "stats" : { /* ... same structure as above ... */ }
      },
      "withOutdatedConfig" : {
        "stats" : { /* ... same structure as above ... */ }
      },
      "totalSummary" : {
        "stats" : { /* ... same structure as above ... */ }
      }
    }
  }
  // ...
}
```

The calculation of these statistics is currently performed for every request and expensive if you have
very many tasks.

#### Specific "embed" parameters for app related information

In this release, we introduce "embed" parameters for all GET requests in the
app end-point that specify which information to embed. Right now, we deliver all
information by default that we delivered before but we encourage you to specify
embed parameters for the information that you need.

In the future, we will only
deliver information you explicitly requested by default, even though we will
allow some compatibility configuration option. This improves performance by not
returning information that you might not need.

#### Smarter resource offer handling

When Marathon needed to launch tasks for multiple apps, it would first launch all needed tasks for the first one
and then proceed to the next app. One big deployment could block all others. In this new version, Marathon
will spread the offers among all apps that currently need to launch tasks.

When Marathon detects new tasks that it has to launch, it will now explicitly request new offers
with the `reviveOffers` Mesos scheduler API call. This should result in more speedy task launches. If
for any reason you dislike this behavior, you can disable it with `--disable_revive_offers_for_new_apps`
(not recommended).

The order in which mesos receives `reviveOffers` and `declineOffer` calls is not guaranteed. Therefore, as
long as we still need offers to launch tasks, we repeat the `reviveOffers` call for `--revive_offers_repetitions`
times so that our last `reviveOffers` will be received after all relevant `declineOffer` calls with high
probability.

* `--revive_offers_repetitions` (Optional. Default: 3):
    Repeat every reviveOffer request this many times, delayed by the `--min_revive_offers_interval`.

When Marathon has no current use for an offer, it will decline the offer for a configurable period. A short duration
might lead to resource starvation for other frameworks if you run many frameworks
in your cluster. You should only need to reduce it if you use `--disable_revive_offers_for_new_apps`.

* `--decline_offer_duration` (Default: 120 seconds) The duration (milliseconds) for which to decline offers by default

#### New task launching tuning parameters

To prevent overloading Mesos itself, you can now restrict how many tasks Marathon launches per time interval.
By default, we allow 1000 unconfirmed task launches every 30 seconds. In addition, Marathon
considers `TASK_RUNNING` status updates from Mesos as launch confirmations and allows launching one more task
for every confirmed launch.

* `--launch_token_refresh_interval` (Optional. Default: 30000):
    The interval (ms) in which to refresh the launch tokens to `--launch_token_count`.
* `--launch_tokens` (Optional. Default: 1000): Launch tokens per interval.

As a result of this, the `--max_tasks_per_offer_cycle` options is deprecated and has no effect anymore.

To prevent overloading Marathon and maintain speedy offer processing, there is also a timeout for matching each
incoming resource offer, i.e. finding suitable tasks to launch for incoming offers.

* `--offer_matching_timeout` (Optional. Default: 1000):
    Offer matching timeout (ms). Stop trying to match additional tasks for this offer after this time.
    All already matched tasks are launched.

All launched tasks are stored before launching them. There is also a new timeout for this:

* <span class="label label-default">v0.11.0</span> `--save_tasks_to_launch_timeout` (Optional. Default: 3000):
    Timeout (ms) after matching an offer for saving all matched tasks that we are about to launch.
    When reaching the timeout, only the tasks that we could save within the timeout are also launched.
    All other task launches are temporarily rejected and retried later.

If the mesos master fails over or in other unusual circumstances, a launch task request might get lost.
You can configure how long Marathon waits for the first `TASK_STAGING` update.

* <span class="label label-default">v0.11.0</span> `--task_launch_confirm_timeout` (Optional. Default: 10000):
  Time, in milliseconds, to wait for a task to enter the `TASK_STAGING` state before killing it.

#### No pseudo-deterministic assignment of host ports anymore

If you specify non-zero `"ports"` in your app JSON, they are used as service ports. The old code contained logic that
would assign these ports as host ports if available in the
processed offer. That misled people into thinking that these ports corresponded to host ports. The new code always
randomizes host ports assignment without `"requirePorts"` or explicit `"hostPort"` configuration.

#### Last task failures are persisted

Marathon has exposed the `"lastTaskFailure"` via the API for a while but this information was not persisted
across restarts or on fail over. Now it is.

#### Logging command line parameters on startup

Marathon will now log all command line parameters on startup. Example:

```
2015-08-02 11:48:08,047] INFO Starting Marathon 0.11.0-SNAPSHOT with --zk zk://master.mesos:2181/marathon --master master.mesos:5050
```

#### Improved logging of deployment plans

Example:

```
DeploymentPlan 2015-09-02T07:56:12.105Z
step 1:
  * Start(App(app1, cmd="cmd")), instances=0)
step 2:
  * Scale(App(app1, cmd="cmd")), instances=2)
```

#### Improved logging of offer rejections

Example for missing port:

```
[2015-08-04 20:11:20,510] INFO Offer [20150804-173037-16777343-5050-4340-O110]. Cannot find range with host port 8080 for app [/product/frontend]
[2015-08-04 20:11:29,422] INFO Offer [20150804-173037-16777343-5050-4340-O110]. Insufficient resources for [/product/frontend] (need cpus=1.0, mem=64.0, disk=1.0, ports=([8080] required + 1 dynamic), available in offer:
...
```

Example for missing basic resources:

```
[2015-08-04 20:17:27,986] INFO Offer [20150804-173037-16777343-5050-4340-O110]. Not all basic resources satisfied: cpu NOT SATISFIED (30.0 > 8.0), disk SATISFIED (0.0 <= 0.0), mem SATISFIED (16.0 <= 15360.0)
[2015-08-04 20:17:27,989] INFO Offer [20150804-173037-16777343-5050-4340-O110]. Insufficient for [/test] (need cpus=30.0, mem=16.0, disk=0.0, ports=(1 dynamic), available in offer:
...
```

#### Immediately store changed apps

In the past, Marathon would update the data for the group endpoint when it accepted a new deployment request
like a change an app configuration. Marathon would only update the data in the app endpoint when it started
the related deployment step. This could cause confusion for our users and thus we will now update both
immediately when accepting the deployment.

#### No automatic reset of the app backoff when detecting a running task

When encountering task failures, Marathon uses the backoff duration to throttle launching tasks.
See `"backoffSeconds"`, `"backoffFactor"` and `"maxLaunchDelaySeconds"` in the REST API documentation
for further information.

There was an undocumented feature that reset the backoff completely whenever Marathon received a TASK_RUNNING
notification from Mesos. This led to problems when an application crashed fast after startup.

In the new Marathon version, the backoff delay is never reset automatically. You can reset it manually, though.

#### New `MARATHON_APP_DOCKER_IMAGE` environment variable

Any task of an app definition with a docker image attribute (`container.docker.image`) will now be started with
an environment variable `MARATHON_APP_DOCKER_IMAGE` containing its value.

#### Define the maximum number of apps that can be created.

This version of Marathon adds the capability to restrict the maximum number of apps, that may be created.
Use the `--max_apps` command line parameter to define this number. It is disabled per default.

### Important bug fixes

* \#1553 -
  Marathon will now correctly reload task state information after a fail over
* \#1924 -
  Marathon will accept offers without disk resources if no disk resources are required
* \#1671 - Mesos will now use the hostname given
  by the `--hostname` parameter to communicate with Marathon
* \#1926 -
  Our leader proxy code used buffered IO without intermediate flushing which did not play well with
  streaming events from our `/v2/events` endpoint
* \#1877 -
  Marathon will now exit on startup failures instead of keeping running without being able to answer to requests.
  For example: Marathon will now exit if the specified http port is already used for something else.

### Known issues

Applications might not be returned for a little while even after `POST /v2/apps` returned 201. This is
side-effect of storing the tasks information in ZooKeeper and we plan to fix it in the next releases.

### Under the Hood

#### Jetty 9 as Servlet Engine

The latest Jetty servlet engine is used in this version of Marathon.
Jetty 9 has a completely overhauled I/O layer, Servlet API 3.0, SPDY/3 and WebSocket support.

#### Improved SSE handling

As part of the Jetty 9 update, the SSE support for `/v2/events` has been improved.
The event name `event: event-name` is added to every `data: json` entry for easier filtering and handling.

#### Play JSON everywhere

We finished our transition from Jackson JSON serialization to Play JSON. Play JSON provides a type safe
interface which make it easier to write correct code.

### Details for Marathon UI

#### New application modal, including Docker-specific fields

The application modal has undergone significant changes, simplifying the app creation process and giving the
user access to more advanced features. In particular, a section of the form is dedicated to Docker specific
fields, allowing the user to create Dockerized applications directly from the UI.

#### Edit application configurations

Previous versions of Marathon did not allow users to make modifications to application configurations after
the application had been created. It's now possible to edit an application using the same improved modal that
is used to create applications.

#### Usability improvements to the applications view

The applications view is the 'dashboard' for Marathon UI. This version brings significant improvements to its
utility, especially by revealing more about application health.

##### Search bar

Applications can be filtered by name using the search bar in the top left-hand corner of the applications view.

##### Show total resource usage

Previously, only the configured resource usage was shown in the applications view, so an application with 100
running tasks would show the same resource usage as an identical application with only 1 running task. Now, the
combined resource usage is shown, allowing users to sort applications by their total assigned resources.

##### Sort applications by health

Unhealthy apps can be found quickly by sorting the application table by health status.

##### Better progress information feedback

A tooltip is displayed when the user hovers the application progress bar, showing individual health statuses.

#### More information on applications and deployments

In previous versions of Marathon, only an application's configuration and healthcheck status were available
from the UI. Marathon 0.11 brings the following features:

##### Debug app tab

A new tab is available in the application detail view. It displays the most recent changes to the application
configuration, the most recent task failure, and the relevant statistics.

##### Health checks in configuration tab.

Application health checks are now shown in the application configuration tab.

##### Direct Mesos sandbox access

Where available, the new 'Mesos details' link in the task detail view shows a link to the relevant sandbox in
the Mesos UI.

#### Other features

##### User- and debug-friendly version strings

The Marathon version string is now shown in the user's local time. In addition, The UI version string is
available when the user hovers the version string, and in a separate alert when the user hits the 'g v'
shortcut.

##### Custom alerts

Where browser-native dialogs were previously used, Marathon now uses custom dialogs which are consistent with
the UI style and which do not interrupt the UI when in the foreground.

##### Not Found page

When the user follows a bad link, they encounter a Not Found page rather than being redirected to the
applications view.

#### UI build uses a webjar

Instead of relying on git submodules, the UI is now released as a webjar which Marathon pulls in during its
own build. This allows developers to use the latest stable UI assets and simplifies the build process. This
has had the side-effect that the ui is now served from the /ui/ endpoint instead of the root.

#### Fixed issues

- \#548 - UI showing empty list after scaling when on page > 1
  * The task list shows the last available page
    if tasks count decreases after scaling.
- \#1872 - Kill & Scale should be available for more than one task

## Changes from 0.9.0 to 0.10.0

### Recommended Mesos version is 0.22.1

We tested this release against Mesos version 0.22.1. Thus, this is the recommended
Mesos version for this release.

### Notes

This will be the last release that supports Java 6, since Java 6 and Java 7 have reached End of Life.
Starting with 0.11.0 we will rely on Java 8.

### Overview

#### Administratively zeroing the task launch delay

It is now possible to reset the task launch delay via the REST endpoint `/v2/queue/{app_id}/delay`.
The UI displays two additional possible statuses: "Delayed" and "Waiting".
The "Delayed" status also displays a tooltip showing the remaining time until the next launch attempt.
The App page now allows the user to reset the task launch delay for a "Delayed" app, thus forcing a new immediate launch attempt.

#### The FrameworkId is invalidated, if the scheduler reports an error

If the scheduler reports an error, the framework id is removed from the backing persistence store.
This is important because on certain kinds of framework errors (such as exceeding the framework failover timeout),
the scheduler may never re-register with the saved FrameworkID until the leading Mesos master process is killed.

#### Maintain constraints while scaling down

Constraints in Marathon is a powerful mechanism.
While the constraints are maintained when scaling up, previous versions of Marathon did not do so while scaling down.
This version picks instances to kill based on defined constraints and will not violate those.

#### Custom prefix for automatically created environment variables

It is now possible to specify a custom prefix via the `--env_vars_prefix`
command line flag. This prefix will be added to the name of task's environment
variables created automatically by Marathon (e.g., `PORT`, `PORTS`)

_Note_: This prefix will not be added to variables that are already prefixed,
such as `MESOS_TASK_ID` and `MARATHON_APP_ID`

#### Handle requests with missing Accept and Content-Type headers correctly

If an HTTP request is made without setting appropriate request headers, the Accept and Content-Type header
is set automatically to `application/json`.

#### Option to restrict the number of concurrent HTTP requests

With this version of Marathon it is possible to restrict the number of concurrent HTTP requests,
that are handled concurrently in the service layer.
This enables the Marathon service to apply back pressure when receiving too many requests
and helps prevent Denial of Service attacks.
If the limit of concurrent requests is reached, a HTTP 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable is returned,
which means that this operation can be retried.
You can turn on this feature by setting the parameter `--http_max_concurrent_requests`.

#### Serialize all concurrent change requests

In former versions of Marathon it was possible that multiple concurrent changes of the same application definition
would lead to an inconsistent state of that application. All changes of groups or application definitions now
get serialized, so the resulting state is always consistent.

#### Enhance the reported metrics

The metrics endpoint (`/metrics`) gives valuable insight into the system behavior.
We now have meters for all service objects as well as the number applications and groups in the system.

#### Decouple API (un)marshalling types from internal models

With this change we can control API changes and are free to change internal models.
This will change nothing in the current API, but will help a lot while we create the v3 API.

### Infrastructure

#### Added integration tests for all API endpoints

We now have an integration test suite, that covers all endpoints with almost all possible parameter combinations.
This test suite runs with every commit on every pull request.
This test suite is our safety net to ensure compatibility while introducing new functionality in future versions.

#### Code coverage reporting using coveralls

See our github page https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon or go directly to
https://coveralls.io/github/mesosphere/marathon to see our code coverage reporting.
With every Pull Request we try to make sure, this coverage will be increased.

#### Improved the release process of Marathon itself

Several changes are made to the sbt build file, but also to the infrastructure that is performing the release.
We now have a more reliable way of pushing distributions.

#### Improve the way in which unused offers are declined, in order to avoid starvation in a multi-framework context.

We have observed that running a large number of frameworks could lead to starvation, in which some frameworks would not receive any offers from the Mesos master. This release includes changes to mitigate offer starvation.
This is done by making the amount of time for which an offer will be declined configurable. This value defaults to 5 seconds (Mesos default), but should be set to a higher value in a multi-framework environment, in order to reduce starvation.
If there is need for an offer (e.g., when a new app is added), then all already declined offers will be actively revived.
`--decline_offer_duration` allows configuring the duration for which unused offers are declined.
`--revive_offers_for_new_apps` if specified, then revive offers will be called when a new app is added to the TaskQueue
`--min_revive_offers_interval` if `--revive_offers_for_new_apps` is specified, do not call reviveOffers more often than this interval.

------------------------------------------------------------


## Changes from 0.8.2 to 0.9.0

#### Recommended Mesos version is 0.22.1

We tested this release against Mesos version 0.22.1. Thus, this is the recommended
Mesos version for this release.

### Breaking changes

Please look at the following changes to check whether you have to verify your setup before upgrading:

* Disk resource limits are passed to Mesos.
* New format for the `http_endpoints` command line parameter.
* New default for the `zk_max_versions` command line parameter. In Marathon, most state is versioned. This includes app
  definitions and group definitions. Marathon already allowed restricting the number of versions that are kept by
  `--zk_max_versions` but you had to specify that explicitly.

  Starting with this version, Marathon will by default keep only 25 versions. That means that Marathon will start to
  remove old versions in order to enforce the limit.
* Removed the deprecated `zk_hosts` and `zk_state` command line parameters. Use the `zk` parameter instead.


### Overview

#### Restrict applications to certain Mesos roles

Prior Marathon versions already support registering with a `--mesos_role`. This causes Mesos to offer resources
of the specified role to Marathon in addition to resources without any role designation ("*").
Marathon would use resources of any role for tasks of any app.

Now you can specify which roles Marathon should consider for launching apps per default via the
`--default_accepted_resource_roles` configuration argument. You can override the default by specifying
a list of accepted roles for your app via the `"acceptedResourceRoles"` attribute of the app definition.

#### Event stream as server sent events

Prior Marathon versions already notified other services of events via
[event subscriptions](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/rest-api.html#event-subscriptions).
Services could register an HTTP endpoint at which they received all events.

The new Marathon now provides an
[event stream](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/rest-api.html#event-stream) endpoint
where you receive all events conveniently as
[Server Sent Events](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_serversentevents.asp).

#### Abstraction for persistent storage added with ZooKeeper access directly in the JVM

A new storage abstraction has been created, which allows for different storage providers. It is completely non-blocking
and provides consistent usage patterns.

The new ZooKeeper Storage Provider is implemented in a backward compatible fashion - the same data format and storage
layout is used as prior versions of Marathon.

You can use this version of Marathon without migrating data while it is also possible to switch back to an older
version. The new persistent storage layer is enabled by default, no further action is needed.


#### Satisfy ports from any offered port range

In prior Marathon versions, matching port resources to the demands of a task had various restrictions:

* Marathon could not launch a task if it required port resources with different Mesos roles.
* Dynamically assigned non-docker host ports had to come from a single port range.

Now the port resources of a task can be satisfied by any combination of port ranges with any matching offered
role.

#### Randomize dynamic docker host ports

If a task reuses recently freed port resources, it can happen that dependencies of old tasks still expect
the old task to be reachable at the old port for a limited time span. For this reason, Marathon has already
randomized assignment of dynamic non-docker host ports to minimize the risk of launching a new task on ports recently
used by other tasks.

Now Marathon also randomly assigns dynamic docker host ports.

#### Disk resource limits are passed to Mesos

If you specify a non-zero disk resource limit, this limit is now passed to Mesos on task launch.

If you rely on disk limits, you also need to configure Mesos appropriately. This includes configuring the correct
isolator and enabling disk quotas enforcement with `--enforce_container_disk_quota`.

#### Improved proxying to current leader

One of the Marathon instances is always elected as a leader and is the only instance processing your requests.
For convenience, Marathon has long proxied all requests to non-leaders to the current leader so that
you do not have to lookup the current leader yourself or are annoyed by redirects.

This proxying has now been improved and gained additional configuration parameters:

* `--leader_proxy_connection_timeout` (Optional. Default: 5000):
    Maximum time, in milliseconds, for connecting to the
    current Marathon leader from this Marathon instance.
* `--leader_proxy_read_timeout` (Optional. Default: 10000):
    Maximum time, in milliseconds, for reading from the
    current Marathon leader.

Furthermore, leader proxying now uses HTTPS to talk to the leader if `--http_disable` was specified.

These bugs are now obsolete:

- #1540 A marathon instance should never proxy to itself.
- #1541 Proxying Marathon requests should use timeouts.
- #1556 Proxying doesn't work for HTTPS.

#### Relative URL paths in the UI

The UI now uses relative URL paths making it easier to run Marathon behind a reverse proxy.

#### Restrict the number of versions by default

In Marathon, most state is versioned. This includes app definitions and group definitions. Marathon already allowed
restricting the number of versions that are kept by `--zk_max_versions` but you had to specify that explicitly.

Since some of our users were running into problems with too many versions, we decided to restrict to
a maximum number of `25` versions by default. We recommend to set this to an even lower number, e.g. `3`, since
higher numbers impact performance negatively.

#### New format for the `http_endpoints` command line parameter

We changed the format of the `http_endpoints` command line parameter from a
space-separated to a comma-separated list of endpoints, in order to be
more consistent with the documentation and with the format used in other
parameters.

WARNING: If you use the `http_endpoints` parameter with multiple space
separated URLs, you will need to migrate to the comma-separated format.

#### Do not delay task launches anymore as a result of failed health checks
Marathon uses an exponential back off strategy to delay further task launches after task failures. This should
prevent keeping the cluster busy with task launches which are set up to fail anyway. The delay was also increased
when health checks failed leading to delayed recovery.

Since health checks typically (depending on configuration) take a while to determine that a task is unhealthy,
this already delays restarting sufficiently.

#### Removed deprecated command line arguments `zk_hosts` and `zk_state`

The command line arguments `zk_hosts` and `zk_state` were deprecated for some time and got removed in this version.
Use the `--zk` command line argument to define the ZooKeeper connection string.


#### servicerouter.py

Is a replacement for the haproxy-marathon-bridge. It reads Marathon task information and generates haproxy
configuration. It supports advanced functions like sticky sessions, HTTP to HTTPS redirection, SSL offloading, VHost
support and templating.

#### Be more careful about using `ulimit` in startup script

The startup script now only increases the maximum number of open files if the limit is too low and if the
script is started as `root`.

------------------------------------------------------------


## Changes from 0.8.1 to 0.8.2

#### New health check option `ignoreHttp1xx`

When set to true, the health check for the given app will ignore HTTP
response codes 100 to 199, in contrast to considering it as unhealthy. With this unbounded task startup times can be handled: the tasks are neither
healthy nor unhealthy as long as e.g. "100 - continue" is returned.

#### HTTPS support for health checks

Health checks now work with HTTPS.

#### Faster (configurable) task distribution

Mesos frequently sends resource offers to Marathon (and all other frameworks). Each offer will represent the available resources of a single node in the cluster. Before this change, Marathon would only start a single task per resource offer, which led to slow task launching in smaller clusters. In order to speed up task launching and use the resource offers Marathon receives from Mesos more efficiently, we added a new offer matching algorithm which tries to start as many tasks as possible per task offer cycle. The maximum number of tasks to start is configurable with the following startup parameters:

`--max_tasks_per_offer` (default 1): The maximum number of tasks to start on a single offer per cycle

`--max_tasks_per_offer_cycle` (default 1000): The maximum number of tasks to start in total per cycle

**Example**

Given a cluster with 200 nodes and the default settings for task launching. If we want to start 2000 tasks, it would take at least 10 cycles, because we are only starting 1 task per offer, leading to a total maximum of 200. If we change the `max_tasks_per_offer` setting to 10, we could start 1000 tasks per offer (the default setting for `max_tasks_per_offer_cycle`), reducing the necessary cycles to 2. If we also adjust the `max_tasks_per_offer_cycle ` to 2000, we could start all tasks in a single cycle (given we receive offers for all nodes).

**Important**

Starting too many tasks at once can lead to a higher number of status updates being sent to Marathon than it can currently handle. We will improve the number of events Marathon can handle in a future version. A maximum of 1000 tasks has proven to be a good default for now. `max_tasks_per_offer` should be adjusted so that `NUM_MESOS_SLAVES * max_tasks_per_offer == max_tasks_per_offer_cycle `. E.g. in a cluster of 200 nodes it should be set to 5.

#### Security settings configurable through env variables

Security settings are now configurable through the following environment variables:

`$MESOSPHERE_HTTP_CREDENTIALS` for HTTP authentication (e.g. `export MESOSPHERE_HTTP_CREDENTIALS=user:password`)

`$MESOSPHERE_KEYSTORE_PATH` + `$MESOSPHERE_KEYSTORE_PASS` for SSL settings

#### Isolated deployment rollbacks

Marathon allows rolling back running deployments via the [DELETE /v2/deployments/{deploymentId}](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/rest-api.html#delete-/v2/deployments/%7Bdeploymentid%7D) command or the "rollback" button in the GUI.

In prior Marathon versions, deployment rollbacks reverted all applications to the state before the selected deployment. If you performed concurrent deployments, these would also be reverted.

Now Marathon isolates the changes of the selected deployment and calculates a deployment plan which prevents changing unrelated apps.

#### Empty groups can be overwritten by apps

Instead of declining the creation of an app with the same name as a previously existing group, the group will now be removed if empty and replaced with the app.

#### Performance improvements

App and task related API calls should be considerably faster with large amounts of tasks now.


------------------------------------------------------------


## Changes from 0.8.0 to 0.8.1

#### New option `dryRun` on endpoint `PUT /v2/groups/{id}`

When sending a group definition to this endpoint with `dryRun=true`,
it will return the deployment steps Marathon would execute to deploy
this group.

#### New endpoint POST `/v2/tasks/delete`

Takes a JSON object containing an array of task ids and kills them.
If `?scale=true` the tasks will not be restarted and the `instances`
field of the affected apps will be adjusted.

#### POST `/v2/apps` rejects existing ids

If an app with an already existing id is posted to this endpoint,
it will now be rejected

#### PUT `/v2/apps/{id}` always returns deployment info

In versions <= 0.8.0 it used to return the complete app definition
if the resource didn't exist before. To be consistent in the response,
it has been changed to always return the deployment info instead. However
it still return a `201 - Created` if the resource didn't exist.

#### GET `/v2/queue` includes delay

In 0.8.0 the queueing behavior has changed and the output of this endpoint
did not contain the delay field anymore. In 0.8.1 we re-added this field.

/**
  * Generic Persistence Store with flexible storage backends using Akka Marshalling Infrastructure.
  *
  * == Providing Serialization for a given class ==
  *  - Provide an [[IdResolver]] for your class for the supported [[PersistenceStore]]s
  *  - Provide a Marshaller and Unmarshaller for
  *    your class and the Serialized form for the supported [[PersistenceStore]]s.
  *  - For example, given a class 'A', a K set to [[mesosphere.marathon.core.storage.store.impl.zk.ZkId]]
  *    and Serialized as [[mesosphere.marathon.core.storage.store.impl.zk.ZkSerialized]],
  *    the following implicits should be sufficient.
  *  - While the implicits can be in the companion object, they may be best suited in a trait mixed
  *    into the according Repository.
  *  - Extend [[mesosphere.marathon.core.storage.repository.impl.PersistenceStoreRepository]] or
  *    [[mesosphere.marathon.core.storage.repository.impl.PersistenceStoreVersionedRepository]] and mix
  *    in the implicits needed.
  * {{{
  *   case class A(id: Int, name: String, version: OffsetDateTime)
  *   object A {
  *     implicit val zkIdResolver = new IdResolver[Int, A, String, ZkId] {
  *       def toStorageId(id: Int, version: Option[OffsetDateTime]): ZkId =

  *       val category = "A"
  *       val maxVersions = 2
  *       def version(a: A): OffsetDateTime = a.version
  *     }
  *     implicit val zkMarshaller = Marshaller[A, ZkSerialized] =

  *       val strLen = it.getInt
  *       val str = new String(it.getBytes(strlen, StandardCharsets.UTF_8))
  *       val time = it.getLong
  *       val offset = it.getInt
  *       val version = OffsetDateTime.ofInstant(Instant.ofEpochMilli(time), ZoneOffset.ofTotalSeconds(offset))
  *       A(id, str, version)
  *     }
  *   }
  * }}}
  *
  * == Notes for implementing new subclasses ==
  *  - A Large amount of the infrastructure is already provided in the
  *    [[mesosphere.marathon.core.storage.store.impl.BasePersistenceStore]] trait, especially
  *    marshalling and unmarshalling and all of the versioning logic.
  *  - Disambiguate the Key and Serialization types when possible,
  *     - e.g. ZkId(String) instead of String, unless they are truly generic,
  *     - e.g. com.google.protobuf.Message can generally be used almost anywhere
  *     that can serialize and deserialize bytes.
  *  - Wrap underlying storage errors in [[mesosphere.marathon.StoreCommandFailedException]],
  *    but leave other exceptions as is.
  *  - Use [[mesosphere.marathon.util.Retry]] - storage layers may have network connectivity issues.
  *  - Ensure your unit test uses the test cases in PersistenceStoreTest and passes all of them.
  *    You may also want to add additional test cases for connectivity.
  *  - Add the type conversions for serialized types, either to their companion object
  *    or within the impl package for your storage layer as appropriate.
  *
  * @tparam K The persistence store's primary key type.
  * @tparam Category The persistence store's category type.
  * @tparam Serialized The serialized format for the persistence store.

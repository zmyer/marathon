# Getting Support for Marathon

Marathon is under constant development by the team at Mesosphere. The team keeps
an eye on questions in a few places.

### Jira Issues
We use JIRA for issue tracking and only keep GitHub issues around to not break existing links. Please file issues [directly in JIRA](https://jira.mesosphere.com/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa?pid=10401).

Use `Improvement` or `Bug` depending on the context of your report. Also make sure to create the issue in project `MARATHON`, which is the preset as per the provided link. You don't need to set any labels, components, or designate an assignee. Yet what helps us triaging your request is used version and environment, steps to reproduce, or any specific use case you have in mind.

You can sign in to JIRA using Github or Google as identity providers.

For all requests specific to the **Marathon UI**, we ask you to kindly supply
the [`gui`](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agui) label.

### Marathon Google Group

The
[**marathon-framework** Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/marathon-framework)
is where team and community members ask and answer longer, potentially open-ended
questions.

### Stack Overflow "marathon" tag

The
["**marathon**" Stack Overflow tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/marathon)
is for specific questions that can be solved with a small amount of code.

      Applies only to top-level object types (of type object). Instructs the RAML
      generator to build a sibling XyzUpdate type (where Xyz is the name of the
      type to which this annoation is applied). If a value is provided here then
      it is used as the name of the generated update-type (instead of XyzUpdate).
  scalaType:
    type: string
    description: |
      Applies to enum types. Overrides the default scala-type name generated
      for the type to which it is applied.
  forceOptional:
    type: nil
    description: |
      Applies to all types. Instruct the RAML generator to force an optional type.
      This can be usefull especially for containers, where the empty container is different than the unspecified container.

      default values. Useful with collection or non-built-in field types.

      Mark a type as internal to indicate, that it is not used in the external API.
      No functional change - only to indicate the use of one type.
